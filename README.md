# RC_CAR_Arduino

I am trying to make an Arduino RC Car which will implement PID and Compass (Magnetometer) Module so that it can change direction according to the user and correct its path accordingly.

The first step of making the RC Car has been completed where I used:
Car Chassis,
Arduino Uno,
Motor Driver(L298N),
4 DC Motors,
Bluetooth Module (HC-06),
Jumper Wires, and
Battery (6V)

I have also attached the .ino file for the RC Control via any bluetooth device.
